# Context Engineering Guide

A framework for understanding and applying context engineering — the practice of designing all information that a language model receives, not just the user-facing prompt.

Based on Andrej Karpathy's definition: "the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step."

## When to Use

- User wants to optimize an LLM application's performance by improving context design
- User asks about the difference between prompt engineering and context engineering
- User is building RAG pipelines, agents, or multi-turn systems and needs context strategy
- User's LLM app produces inconsistent or low-quality outputs despite good prompts

## When NOT to Use

- User is writing a single one-off prompt for a chatbot (prompt engineering is fine for this)
- User needs help with model fine-tuning or training (different domain)
- User is asking about prompt injection / security (use a security-focused skill)

## Core Framework: The 4 Operations

Context engineering consists of four distinct operations on the context window:

### 1. Write

Craft the static components: system instructions, task descriptions, output format specs, persona definitions.

Key principle: be specific about constraints and format, not just intent.

### 2. Select

Choose the right dynamic information to include: retrieved documents (RAG), conversation history, tool outputs, user metadata.

Key principle: relevance > recency. Not everything recent is relevant; not everything relevant is recent.

### 3. Compress

Reduce information to fit the context window without losing critical signal: summarize long documents, extract key facts, truncate old conversation turns.

Key principle: preserve decision-relevant information. Summaries should retain what the model needs to act on, not just what happened.

### 4. Isolate

Separate concerns into distinct context segments to avoid interference: use system vs user vs assistant roles intentionally, separate instructions from data, use XML tags or markdown headers as boundaries.

Key principle: clear boundaries prevent the model from confusing instructions with data.

## Decision Framework

```
Is the LLM app a single prompt?
  YES -> Prompt engineering is sufficient
  NO  -> Context engineering required
    |
    v
What goes wrong?
  |
  +-- Irrelevant outputs    -> SELECT problem (wrong docs retrieved, wrong history included)
  +-- Inconsistent format   -> WRITE problem (weak system instructions)
  +-- "Forgets" earlier info -> COMPRESS problem (context window overflow, poor summarization)
  +-- Confuses data vs instructions -> ISOLATE problem (no clear boundaries)
```

## Key Concepts

### Context Window as RAM

The context window is not a chat log — it is the model's entire working memory. Everything the model knows about the current task must be in this window. Design it like you would design a function's input parameters: intentionally, with the right type and amount of information.

### The 60/30/10 Rule (Production Failures)

In production LLM applications, approximately:
- 60% of failures are **context problems** (wrong, missing, or stale information in the window)
- 30% are **reasoning problems** (model can't solve the task even with perfect context)
- 10% are **prompt problems** (awkward phrasing, missing instructions)

Most teams over-invest in prompt tweaking when the real issue is context design.

### Prompt Engineering vs Context Engineering

| Aspect | Prompt Engineering | Context Engineering |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | The user instruction | Everything the model sees |
| Focus | Phrasing and structure | Information selection and architecture |
| Components | Task description, few-shot examples | Memory, retrieval, tools, state, history, metadata |
| When it works | Simple, single-turn tasks | Production systems, agents, multi-turn workflows |
| Failure mode | "Rephrase until it works" | "Design the information pipeline" |

## Common Anti-Patterns

1. **Context overload** — Dumping everything into the window "just in case." The model wastes attention on irrelevant information, and costs increase.
2. **Stale context** — Using cached summaries or outdated tool outputs. The model confidently acts on wrong information.
3. **Missing memory** — No mechanism to carry information across turns or sessions. The model starts fresh every time.
4. **Blurred boundaries** — User data mixed with system instructions. The model treats user-provided text as instructions (prompt injection risk).
5. **Retrieval without ranking** — RAG that returns top-k documents without relevance scoring. Quantity != quality.

## Output Template

When analyzing an LLM application's context engineering:

```
## Context Engineering Analysis: [Application Name]

### Current Context Architecture
- System prompt: [length, key components]
- Dynamic context: [what gets injected and how]
- History management: [how conversation turns are handled]
- Tool integration: [what tools provide context]

### Diagnosis
- WRITE: [assessment of static instructions]
- SELECT: [assessment of dynamic information selection]
- COMPRESS: [assessment of information density and summarization]
- ISOLATE: [assessment of boundary clarity]

### Recommendations
1. [Highest-impact change]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

### Expected Impact
[What improvement to expect and how to measure it]
```

## Examples

### Example 1: RAG Pipeline Optimization

User: "My RAG chatbot answers questions about our docs, but often gives wrong answers even though the right document is in our collection."

Analysis:
- **SELECT problem**: Retrieval returns top-5 by embedding similarity, but relevance != similarity. A document about "pricing" might be similar to "billing" but not answer "how to cancel."
- **COMPRESS problem**: Full documents are stuffed into context. Key facts buried in noise.
- Recommendation: Add a reranking step after retrieval (SELECT), extract relevant paragraphs instead of full docs (COMPRESS), add source attribution instructions (WRITE).

### Example 2: Agent System Context Design

User: "My coding agent loses track of what it's doing after 3-4 tool calls."

Analysis:
- **COMPRESS problem**: Raw tool outputs (full file contents, long command outputs) fill the context window. After 4 calls, earlier task context gets pushed out.
- **ISOLATE problem**: Tool outputs and agent reasoning are interleaved without clear boundaries.
- Recommendation: Summarize tool outputs to key facts before adding to context (COMPRESS), use structured sections: `[TASK]`, `[PROGRESS]`, `[TOOL_OUTPUT]`, `[NEXT_STEP]` (ISOLATE), periodically re-inject the original task description (WRITE).
